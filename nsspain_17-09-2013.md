## Digital Selfdorm and how to avoid it:
### Aral Balkan ( @aral )

- UX talk: [thelink.is/uxtalk](http://thelink.is/uxtalk)
- things as they are, works well by themselfs, but you need to check how things work together...
- if a gesture is cathastrophic, is easy to make harder to complete it
- the feature era is dead. We are living the age of experiences
- joshua topolsky, continuos client, continuo experience
- new startup: Shnail Mail. solve the real mail problem. real mail forever. WTF!
- privacy is about having the control about what and where to share stuff. VIDEO: tacma.net
- the alternative is to own your own data. we must create seamless open technologies.
- the open community is in the feature age. the trickle-down technology.
- [thelink.is/designisnotveneer](thelink.is/designisnotveneer)
- design is assumption. and leds creation. Design leads dev. dev informs design
- indie Data. 
- prometheus, startup. codename-prometheus.eu
- **how to create a open experiences withous the infrastructure of big companies**



## UIAccesibility + UIAutomation
### Sommer Panage  ( @sommer )

####UIAccesibility

- why AX matter?: to make technology accesible for everyone.
- code demo…
- UIAccesibilityReadingContent Protocol: to read large blocks of text.
- 90% of AX just needs attributes
- UIKit has by default some AX
- **Custom accesibility**: implementando AX en nuestras apps, podemos controlar lo que se dice cuando el bloque de lectura esta encima de nuestros controles
- podemos igualmente crear nuestras experiencias, agrupando componentes para que sea mas entendible para usuarios ciegos.
- the AccesibilityFrame in SCREEN COORDINATES always.
- el orden de las cosas en lo que respecta a AX no importa

####UIAutomation
- you can use accesibility names to test your app via UIAutomation, is easier with names…



##Core Graphics + Core Animation
###Nacho Soto ( @nachosoto )

- NSAssert
- test all the anims on the device…..
- sprites en iOS!!
- Sorry, to much code, not to much info :S



##Cocoapods
###Orta Therox ( @orta ) & Fabio Pelosin ( @fabiopelosin )
- 2 years, 1,400 contributors, 2,300 Libraries, 4,000 Pull request, 6,000 Podspecs, 220,000 downloads
- Crafter, tool for cocoapods


#Workshop 01 - TDD
###Fernando Rodriguez

- we are going to cover some basic concepts that will need to be cristal clear when we leave today
- (TDD pic :P )
- when you do TDD you actually develop driven dictaded, driven by a test… dont write a line of code if all is tested.
- this can make you far more productive…
####Steps
1. **Red**: write a test that fails
2. **Green**: Make the code work. ugly code, dont worry about clean code here.
3. **Refactor**: find the must simple possible solution

> "Clear code that works" - Ward Cunningham

1. Should be predictable
2. should be reusable
3. independent from the enviroment: Should only fail if the code is broken
4. Easy to modify

> Do not test code that you are not responsable for

##THE MANTRA
###- WRITE CODE ONLY IF YOUR TEST FAILS
###- Remove duplication

##Tools
1. OCUnit
2. XCUnit
3. GHUnit
4. Kiwi

- every test should be completely individual
- is uses macros
- THIS IS THE NEW PRIORITY, the new test SHOULD ALWAYS PASS

###Operation
1. **Create a new target with the test:**
2. **your test should be as fast as possible**

##a test…
- should be fast
- should be repeatable
- have a clear and explicit name
- should test one thing
- only fails if the code is broken


#The App
###an App that helps me to che the different currencies of the money that i have.

- two equal objects must have the same hash ( ? )
- your test should look like logical statements, not as a list of operations
